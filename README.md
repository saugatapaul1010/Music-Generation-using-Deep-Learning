# Music-Generation-using-Deep-Learning-LSTM-
In this repository, I will build a simple AI which generates piano music. A special type of Recurrent Neural Networks called LSTM is used for this software. The two most important concepts covered in this case study are time distributed dense layer and stateful RNNS. The documentation will be updated in some days.
